                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">We have a channel in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/ppy">osu! development
                        Discord server</a></p>

                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Spectators are any users who don't have at least 3 ranked maps. They can view the website, but cannot interact with the guild (add beatmaps,

                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Unpublished songs/artists will occasionally be available to map through rank-restricted
                    quests, meaning you'll need to have a certain amount of experience creating maps through the
                    Mappers' Guild before you can access them. Tier 1 members may be asked privately to make beatmaps for new 
                    featured artist songs as well.</p>

                    of the <a href="/beatmaps">beatmaps page</a> will open a new map creation form. Select an artist, one of their
                    songs, and any difficulties you want to map/lock. <button

                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Any user can add a difficulty themselves, so long as the mapset host hasn't disabled it.
                    A mapset host can also invite a user to create a difficulty filling the box <input
                        class="form-control form-control-sm d-inline w-auto" type="text" placeholder="request to... (if needed)"

                    Clicking that opens an input field where you can add any mapper you want to collaborate with. This
                    will send the mapper an invite, and if they accept, they'll be added to the task's mapper list!</p>

                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">To change the status of a full mapset, its host can use the 
                    <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-success">Done</button> and 
                    <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-warning">WIP</button> buttons. 
                    A mapset marked as "Work-in-progress (WIP)" allows other users to create difficulties. A mapset
                    marked as "Done" does not allow any modification and will be automatically marked as 
                    "Qualified" if the map's link is correct. 
                </p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">How do I make my map's card use my map's background?</h5>

                            class="fas fa-edit"></i></a> button and input your map's osu! web link. Only links to the
                    new site (such as /beatmapsets/123456 rather than /s/123456) will generate card images, but any
                    links are acceptable.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">When do I mark myself as a modder?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50"><i>After</i> you've modded a mapset. Before a mapset is marked as Ranked, someone else
                    will ensure you actually modded. If a map is ranked before you have a chance to mark yourself as a modder, you
                    won't be able to add yourself to the modders list.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">When do I mark myself as a potential Beatmap Nominator?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Any time. If you're a BN and you're interested in nominating a mapset, adding yourself
                    to this list will let the mapper know who to contact when the mapset is ready! Marking yourself as a
                    BN does not reward any points -- modding does, however!</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What do I do if I don't want anyone to claim a difficulty on my mapset?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">The "lock" feature disables difficulty claims for any difficulty you mark. Guest
                    difficulty invites can bypass locks.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">How and why do I link a mapset to a quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">If you're currently running a quest, clicking the <a href="#" class="icon-valid" 
                    onclick="event.preventDefault()"><i class="fas fa-edit"></i></a> button in the "Quest"
                    field will show a dropdown menu for your active quests. When a mapset is linked to a quest, 
                    only people running the quest are able to claim difficulties.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Are mapsets for different game modes allowed?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Yes.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Are hybrid game mode mapsets allowed?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Yes.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Can I cut songs?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Yes, so long as it is still a reasonable length (so like, avoid anything below 1:30).</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Why do I need to use a licensed image as my map's background?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">The Mappers' Guild exists to create licensed content for osu!, so licensed backgrounds
                    are required as well.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12 segment mx-auto" id="quest">
                <h4>Quest</h4>
    
                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Why is there a time limit on quests?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Things don't get done without one. The Mappers' Guild so far has been able to produce
                    packs consistently because it has deadlines, and quests continue that system. If you're not a fan of
                    deadlines, you can still participate in the Mappers' Guild without running quests or purchase extensions
                    to quests with Mappers' Guild points!</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Why can't I accept a quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">You must be a party's leader and your party must meet the quest's requirements. Usually, 
                    this involves a member of your party having too few Mappers' Guild points available.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What happens when I accept a quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">You and your party are tasked with completing it by the date labeled in the quest listing.
                    Each member of the party will spend the amount of points specified on the quest to accept it. If a member does not
                    have enough points, the quest cannot be accepted.
                </p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What happens when I don't finish a quest by the deadline?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Quests reward bonus points, and if you're late, you'll recieve less bonus points.
                    Bonus points scale down in increments after missing the deadline. Portions of bonus points are lost after 20 days,
                    40 days, and 60 days. Deadline extensions can be purchased with Mappers' Guild points to avoid these points losses.
                    If you drag a quest on indefinitely, it'll be marked as dropped.
                </p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What happens when I drop a quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">The quest is re-opened. You will not gain any quest bonus points and you will have 
                    already lost points when accepting the quest. There was previously a penalty for dropping quests, but that
                    has since been removed.
                </p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Why can't I join a party while it's running a quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">This is done to avoid users joining quests late for easy access to rewards. Organize
                    your parties before accepting a quest or else you might regret it! This only applies 7 days after
                    a quest the quest is accepted though -- a party's leader can invite anyone within that week long period!</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Why can't people outside my party participate in quest-related maps?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">A quest is designed to be handled by the subgroup of a specified size that signs up for
                    it.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What are quests with a "?" as their icon?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">These are special quests potentially involving unannounced featured artists or are not specific
                    to any featured artists (but usually the first one). They may be rank-limited to ensure the quest will be 
                    completed and its artist will not be leaked. Instructions about how to handle these quests will be explained
                    privately to their undertaking parties.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What happens if I leak anything about a special quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Your party will be removed from the Mappers' Guild and if any members re-join, they will
                    not be allowed to handle info-sensitive quests.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What do I do when I complete a quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">If all mapsets linked to a quest are Ranked, it will be reviewed and marked as completed. If
                    you complete your quest and it isn't marked as completed within a few days, talk to pishifat.</p>
                
                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What is an expired quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">If a quest is open after more than 3 months, it will move to the expired quests section.
                    Expired quests can be re-opened by spending Mappers' Guild points.
                </p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">How do I re-open an expired quest?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Mappers' Guild points can be spent to re-open expired quests from the expired 
                    quests section.
                </p>
                
                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Can a quest be handled by mappers from multiple game modes?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Yes, as long as the mappers are in the same party.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">How are party ranks chosen?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">A party's rank is an average of its members' user ranks, rounded up to the nearest whole
                    number. This means a rank 0 and a rank 1 user in the same party would form a rank 1 party (0.5
                    rounded up)</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">How do I stop other mappers from joining my party?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">A party's leader can lock new member admissions.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">How do I get other people to join my party?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Users can join any open party on their own. A party's leader can also invite other users
                    to join the party after clicking on a party's card.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What happened to quests with medals?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Quests will be rewarded medals on a case-by-case basis. If you want to have your quest's
                    maps featured in an achievement/medal, ensure that it has low difficulties (Normal or lower) and 
                    has at least 6 mapsets total!

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Does song length affect points earned?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Yes. Maps 2.75 minutes long reward points at the base values listed on the home page.
                    Maps below that length reward less and maps above that length reward more, with diminishing returns
                    as a map gets continuously longer. </p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">When are points rewarded?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Mapping-related points are rewarded upon a mapset reaching Ranked status. Quest-related
                    points are rewarded upon a quest being marked as complete.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">When are rewards given?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Badges are published every 2-3 months. Medals are published at no set interval.</p>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">Can I earn points for X?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">If you don't see it mentioned anywhere, no. For extra clarity, here's some examples of
                    things that do not reward points:</p>
                <ul class="text-white-50">
                    <li>Anything unrelated to osu!'s featured artists</li>
                    <li>Mapsets you've ranked before joining the Mappers' Guild</li>
                    <li>Guest difficulties for mapsets uninvolved with the Mappers' Guild</li>
                    <li>Mapsets with participation from users uninvolved in the Mappers' Guild</li>
                    <li>Skinning and background creation (these gave small points rewards in the past)</li>
                    <li>Hitsounding (this is part of a host's bonus points)</li>
                    <li>Mapset with non-osu!-licensed background/storyboard content</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="ml-3 mt-4">What happens if someone abuses the points system?</h5>
                <p class="ml-4 text-white-50">Any intentionally harmful actions will result in temporary or permanent removal from the
                    Mappers' Guild depending on severity. For example, if a user marks themselves as having created
                    difficulties when in reality they haven't, they'll be removed.</p>
