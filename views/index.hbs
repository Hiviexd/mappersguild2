        <h4>What is the Mappers' Guild?</h4>
        <p class="ml-4">In short, it's a group of mappers responsible for creating maps for osu!'s featured artists! You may have seen our maps included in map pack/hush hush medals, as well as news posts like...</p>

        <p class="ml-4">The Mappers' Guild has been running for more than a year with participation from around 40 mappers. Through this website and automated functionality, we're now able to bring in more mappers (potentially including you)!</p>

    <h4>How does the Mappers' Guild work?</h4>
    <p class="ml-4">In addition to making maps of music licensed by osu!, the Mappers' Guild has similaritiess to any other MMO-style guild. We support subgroups of mappers (parties) working together to create map packs for specifically assigned artists or other content (quests). By creating maps and participating in the mapping process, a user can earn points and level up to receive rewards!</p>
    <div class="col-md-6 mt-2">
        <h5>Quests</h5>
        <p class="ml-4">Quests reward mappers for following certain requirements when creating their featured artist beatmaps.</p>
        <p class="ml-4">For example, a quest's objective could be "<i>create 5 mapsets of songs from Camellia</i>", necessitating a party of 5-10 members and completion within 3 months.</p>
        <p class="ml-4">If a party accepts and completes the quest according to its rules, each party member will be rewarded point bonuses. If a party drops the quest, they will lose points.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 mt-2">
        <h5>Parties</h5>
        <p class="ml-4">Parties are groups of mappers who register to complete quests together. Mappers may join one party at a time and each party may undertake one quest at a time.</p>
        <p class="ml-4">Special quests require higher ranks to participate in. For a party to qualify as a higher rank, at least half of its members must be the required rank or higher.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="ml-4">Quests and parties are rewarding ways to get involved with the Mappers' Guild, however our main goal is to produce maps for osu!'s featured artists, and that can be done however you prefer!</p>
